# Yu-Gi-Oh Benchmark

Duelingbook replay sources and reviewed decision benchmarks for testing how
well an LLM plays Yu-Gi-Oh through
[yugioh-harness](https://github.com/SeucheAchat9115/yugioh-harness).
The agent interprets card rules and chooses moves; this repository does not
implement a card-effects engine.

**Status: alpha toolkit.** Replay importing, reviewed-case execution and the
three-KPI artifact scorer and automated metered checkpoint runner are implemented. A [first scoped replay suite](docs/replay-review-stage.md) is prepared. The
[completed Luna run](docs/results/2026-10-09/README.md) reports all
three KPIs on 18 reviewed replay checkpoints. A complete live-duel evaluation
remains pending. The separate [small Edison pilot](docs/edison-pilot.md) measured
state recreation and legality only.
This project is independent of Duelingbook and the Yu-Gi-Oh rights holders.

## Agentic benchmark score

The benchmark evaluates an agent working through the harness, with three equally
weighted KPIs:

| KPI | What it measures | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State recreation | Does the agent orchestrate a player-declared play and produce the correct game state? | ⅓ |
| Human-move agreement | Does the agent choose the same semantic move as the reviewed human replay? | ⅓ |
| Rule correctness | Is the agent's play legal under the pinned format, banlist and card text? | ⅓ |

**Final score = the average of the three KPI percentages.** A different legal
move can pass rule correctness while failing human-move agreement. The current
plotted result is **GPT-6 Luna** (`gpt-6-luna`). Future runs use the
[evaluation configuration](benchmarks/evaluation-config.json).

The [automated evaluation runner](docs/automated-evaluation.md) sends identical
filtered prompts, receives structured intentions, independently reviews legality,
and executes through the real harness. It records per-call time, tokens and costs
and generates four accuracy/runtime panels plus four accuracy/cost panels.
The [KPI scorer](docs/agentic-kpis.md) also accepts separately collected artifacts.
Missing attempts score zero, while unfinished grading blocks a final score.
A high task score alone does not establish competitive playing strength.

## Scoped replay results

![Completed Luna checkpoint performance](docs/results/2026-10-09/performance.png)

| KPI | GPT-6 Luna |
| --- | ---: |
| State recreation | 94.44% (17/18) |
| Human-move agreement | 50.00% (9/18) |
| Rule correctness | 88.89% (32/36) |
| **Equal-weight final score** | **77.78%** |

All 36 tasks are graded across 18 independently reset positions. The current
plots show only this completed native Luna run; the earlier assisted Sol and
Luna points have been removed. Independent journal replay reproduced the score.

![Luna performance versus cost; measured USD cost unavailable](docs/results/2026-10-09/performance-cost.png)

Native subagents did not report tokens or billing, so cost is **unavailable**.
The plot uses an explicitly labeled categorical position, rather than assigning
zero USD. Comparable runtime is also unavailable because collection combined
archived answers with manual preparation and waiting. The
[runtime plots, reproducible summaries and methodology](docs/results/2026-10-09/README.md)
record these limits. This is cooperative checkpoint evaluation with automated
legality reviews; a continuous duel remains unevaluated. The report discloses
five excluded referee-input trials and one corrective player dispatch for an
incorrect input, with zero performance-selected retries.

## Replay dataset and importing

The selected [Aco77 vs sdesowitz02 replay](https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=40753-85958923)
now uses the [supplied native JSON](fixtures/duelingbook/aco77-sdesowitz02-2026-10-07.json)
and [native bundle](replays/db-json-40753-85958923) as its primary source:
**554 source plays, two games, 174 review candidates**. It adds private draw
observations for both players, card definitions, shuffle references and absolute
LP updates. The [source registry](benchmarks/sources.json) links the JSON fixture,
bundle, hashes, card references and review candidates. Its identity is
`db-json-40753-85958923`.

The [whole-match review](docs/replay-review-stage.md) covers all 207 work items
across both games. All 185 previously pending items now have dispositions:
14 newly approved, 77 excluded as bookkeeping/substeps and 94 reviewed but blocked.
The suite has **18 scoped checkpoints and 36 tasks**, including the original four.
These are independent resets, not an uninterrupted match. The earlier four-position
cooperative pilot scored 70.83%; the expanded assisted pilots scored **78.70% for
Sol and 54.63% for Luna**. These results do not establish competitive strength.
The user identifies the match as
**Perfect Circle 2007**; historical-text-dependent cases remain provisional and
the native export itself labels the game Unlimited.

For each new match, open the browser inspector’s **Network → Fetch/XHR** tab,
reload the replay and copy the complete **`view-replay` JSON response** to a file.
Supply the replay URL and played format alongside it. Follow the
[step-by-step acquisition guide](docs/acquisition.md), including its coverage
checks. HTML exports and copied duel text are unsupported.

Importing runs offline without runtime dependencies, browser setup or credentials.
Each native play has a numbered, hashed event file and its original source index.
Unknown cards, missing timestamps and manual operations remain available for review.

An orchestrator can import files internally in response to a natural language
request. Duel players do not need to run Python themselves. Maintainer commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SeucheAchat9115/yugioh-benchmark.git
cd yugioh-benchmark
python -m pip install .
yugioh-benchmark convert-json imports/replay.json --source https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=40753-85958923 --output replays/my-native-match
yugioh-benchmark inspect replays/db-json-40753-85958923
# Reconstruct reviewer-only observations; these are not scored cases:
yugioh-benchmark extract replays/db-json-40753-85958923 --output inspection/db-json-40753-85958923
# Score a reviewed suite and its trusted run artifacts:
yugioh-benchmark score-kpis suite.json run.json
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

[Offline CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) tests Python 3.11–3.13 on Linux and Windows and
checks the filtered benchmark bridge against the pinned harness.
Replay conversion and human-move/legality artifact scoring do not require the harness.
State-recreation KPI scoring requires the harness to verify journals. Running
an agent through the bridge requires a separate harness checkout and your own
bounded model transport; see [harness setup](docs/harness-integration.md).

Raw imports and evaluation runs stay local and ignored. Deliberately selected
