# Code license and selected source data

Repository code and documentation use the MIT license in `LICENSE`. This
license does not grant rights to third-party game text, replay content,
usernames or chat. Replay fixtures, their derived observation bundles and
candidate indexes are separately attributed source data.

`fixtures/duelingbook/aco77-sdesowitz02-2026-10-07.txt` was supplied by the user
for this repository on 2026-10-08, together with its source URL:
https://www.duelingbook.com/replay?id=40753-85958923.

Its derived bundle and benchmark candidate index are linked in
`benchmarks/sources.json`. No external license statement was supplied.

`fixtures/duelingbook/aco77-sdesowitz02-2026-10-07.json` is the user-supplied
Duelingbook `view-replay` export for the same match, supplied on 2026-10-08.
It is now the primary selected source. Account/display metadata was removed;
gameplay entries, private/public logs and card definitions remain source data.
Its uploaded-byte digest and selected fixture/canonical payload digests are
recorded separately in the registry. The original text remains a companion.
The JSON includes both players' private card observations and must never be
passed directly to an evaluated player. These source data are not MIT licensed.
No artwork is included; this notice does not claim ownership of Yu-Gi-Oh
card names or game text.

The fixture preserves the participants' displayed usernames and match chat;
it is not anonymized. Its source URL is attribution, not a license statement.
No separate third-party redistribution license was supplied.

Git history also contains the removed `replays/db-2178594` archive fixture from
`nedhmn/duel-tools`, originally supplied under MIT. Its original attribution,
license notice and pinned provenance remain in the commits containing it.

`benchmarks/card-metadata/db-json-40753-85958923.json` contains selected card
names, descriptions and statistics retrieved from the YGOPRODeck v7 API on
2026-10-08. Source: https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php ; documentation:
https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/ . Retrieval timestamp, exact passcode query and
response/selected-data digests are stored in the snapshot. This third-party
game material is not relicensed under MIT; no separate redistribution license
was established. No artwork, prices or set lists are included.
